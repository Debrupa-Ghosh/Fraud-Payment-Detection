Fraud Payment Detection Model: 

•	Built payment fraud detection models in Python (scikit learn, imbalanced learn), with pipelines for preprocessing, resampling (SMOTE/undersampling), and model tuning; emphasized recall/PR AUC over accuracy for imbalanced data. 

•	Delivered interactive visualizations and monitoring (confusion matrix, ROC/PR curves, feature importance) to surface trade offs and guide thresholding for production alerts.
